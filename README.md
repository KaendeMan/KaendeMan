### Personal Blog Website

As someone who loves both writing and web development, I creating a personal blog website to share my thoughts and insights on topics ranging from technology to travel. The website features a clean and minimalist design, allowing the focus to remain on the content. Readers can browse through various categories, leave comments on posts, and subscribe for updates.

The blog is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the backend powered by a simple Node.js server. I also integrated a Markdown parser to easily write and format my blog posts. The project showcases my front-end and back-end development skills, as well as my ability to create user-friendly and visually appealing web interfaces.
